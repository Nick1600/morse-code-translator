### Morse Code Translator App
-----------------------------

This is a very basic app that translates normal text and some punctuation into Morse Code in real time. My wife and I were wanting to learn Morse Code, but I decided that it would be easier to build a translator than actually learn Morse Code. Work smarter not harder.

This app was made with: 
 - create-react-app
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JSX

 I am really happy with how this has turned out. Some challenges that I was focusing on was the 'separation of concerns'. I achieved this by separating the MorseIndex object, and the Translator function into their own respective files, and importing them to their respective react components.

 I am always welcome to feedback!
